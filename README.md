# McScript (temporary name)


A simple and powerful tool to generate datapacks for minecraft.

Getting Started:
================

Make sure to have python >= 3.8 installed.

ToDo: Documentation of the language. For now just check the example scripts.

McScript is a compiler to create datapacks (planned backends include also command blocks), which tries to allow high-level programming while allowing much control of the generated commands. The generated code is highly efficient and can often compete with manually written datapacks. Because of its macro system, mcscript allows you to quickly generate commands which would be very annoying to use manually, like getting the id of a block and turning this id into the same block again.
