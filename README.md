# McScript (temporary name)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Inky-developer/McScript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Inky-developer/McScript)

A simple and powerful tool to generate datapacks for minecraft.

Examples can be found in tests/scripts.

To run all unittests you can include a directoy tests/server which contains a server (minimum version 1.15) and a world file named McScript.

ToDo: Documentation of the language. For now just check the example scripts.
