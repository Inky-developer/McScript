# McScript (temporary name)

A simple and powerful tool to generate datapacks for minecraft.

Getting Started:
================

Make sure to have python >= 3.8 installed.

Examples can be found in tests/scripts.
McScript can automatically run tests on a minecraft server. To enable this, start a minecraft server on localhost, enable rcon on port 25575 and set the passwort to 1234 in the server.properties. 

ToDo: Documentation of the language. For now just check the example scripts.
